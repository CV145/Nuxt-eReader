Explore the entire 
  repository to 
  understand the 
  codebase from 
  multiple angles: as a
   software architect, 
  software developer 
  and product manager. 
  I want you to compile
   your findings into a
   very extensive 
  Markdown document in 
  the root of the 
  repository. For 
  describing technical 
  concepts, you should 
  include Mermaid 
  diagrams in this 
  Markdown file

(Can always ask AI to update document based on latest code)

  I want you to act as a Product 
  Manager for the web eReader. We 
  need a mind map note-taking system,
   where notes can be viewed side by 
  side with the text, and a notes 
  page being associated per chapter. 
  The eReader should also have the 
  option to display just one 
  paragraph at a time, with spacebar 
  being used to advance forward to 
  the next paragraph. Do not code 
  anything yet; instead, deeply think
   about which requirements we need 
  and describe the user stories in 
  detail in a Product Requirements 
  Document markdown file.
